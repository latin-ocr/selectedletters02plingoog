NOTES.

‘si quadringentis sex septem millia desunt
Plebs eris’ Hor. Ep. r. r. 58.

37. His, sc. posteris.

38. condicionibus, allianoe in marriage. Cp. ‘inter altissimas con-
diciones’ Ep. 6. 28.

Hic qnoque ponendus est calculus, ‘this too must be taken into
account:’ literally, ‘this counter must be placed! ‘Parem caleulum
ponere,' ‘to pay an equivalent’ Ep. 45. 1. ‘Omnes qnos ego movi, calculos
pone’ Bk. a. 19, ‘take into account every argument that 1 have suggested!

43. onerare, ‘to overload!

up. 10. 1. Promittisa understand ‘te ventumm esse! The ellipsis is
not unusual. ‘Ad cenam alio promisi foras' Plaut. Stich. 4. a. 16. ‘Ad
cenam mihi promitte’ Phaedr. 4. 24. 15.

4. Num hano quoquo ..... ferculo, ‘you will have to reckon in your
account this too (nivem), which melted in the dish.'

5. Botooei. Properly an adjective, but used, like ‘malvaceus' from
‘malva' as a diminutive substantive for 'beta' Perhaps agreeing with
‘pedes’ understoodt ‘beet-root!

6. Bulbi, edible roots (as onions and others); it is uncertain of what
exact kind.

Audisses comoedos vel lectorem. Such amusements at meals were
common among the Romans, and with Pliny himself. ‘Cenanti mihi,
si cum uxore vel paucis, liber legitur: post cenam comoedus aut lyristes’

up. 11. Erucius, to whom this letter is addressed, is probably Sextus
Erucius Clams, of whom Pliny speaks in the highest terms iu Bk. a. 9. The
family of the Clari at this time were eminent not only in rank, bnt also for

virtue and talents. The uncle of ¹Sextus was Septicius, to whom Pliny
dedicates his letters (1. 1), ‘the most tmthiul, single-minded, candid,
faithful of men3' and Marcius the father of Sextus was a man of uprightness
and ability; Bk. a. 9. Sextus himself, for whom Pliny obtained from Trajan
the ‘latus clavus‚' giving him admission into the senate, was praesset of the
city and twice consul: he was remarkable for his devotion to ancient
literature. Α. Gellius, 6. 63 13. 17, quoted in Smith's Diet. Biog. This

accomplished family formed part oi that circle oi literary friends in
which Pliny lived: they seem moreover to have been generally men of
high character in public and private.

1. Hunc dloo nostrum, ‘1 mean my friend Pompeius ;’ perhaps inserted
because there were others of the same name. Nothing more is known of
