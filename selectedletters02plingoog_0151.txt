Germaniae latissime victor. Although ‘ victor’ here retains its
original suhst. meaning and construction, governing the genitive, yet we

In aex volumine. ‘Liber' and ‘volumen’ were originally synony-

was retained ior this meaning, while the extent of the ‘liber' was faxed by
the limita of the subject aud the design of the author, not by the accidental

28. Statim a nocte multe. At once, before the days really grew short,
be took, even in August, a great portion of the night for study; hut in the
winter he took as much aa five-twelfths of it for that purpose. The Roman
days and nights were reckoned from sunrise and sunset respectively; and
