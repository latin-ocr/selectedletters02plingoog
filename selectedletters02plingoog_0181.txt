stantia' Sen. Qsaest. Nat. 4. a. Verbs compounded with ‘ex' which signify
motion, generally take the accusative, rarcly the ablative, unless the pre·
position is repeated before the substantive.

7. stipes, ‘small coins' Seneca, in the passage quoted above, speaks of

Ι ‘stipes ’ thtown into the stream hythe priests.

8. Devexitote. Substantives ending in ‘tas' are properly formed from
adjectives only, Madvig, 5 184. 1. But ‘devexus' being adjectival iu sense
enjoys the privileges of an adjective. Se also we have from ‘falsus’

‘falsitas' which has better authority than ‘devexitas' lt was by the ,
multiplicatiora of these convenient derivatives that the vocabulary was =

increased, while tbe language was enervated.

9. Fons adhue et iem amplissimum tlumsne a virid way ot r
describing the quick transition from a merc spring to a river, which transitiou ἶ

was the real marvel ol the place; cp. ‘Subita et ex abdito vasti amnis emptio
aras babet’ Seu. Ep. 41. ‘Est' followed by a comma, suggests itself as an
easy emendation for ‘ct' and would simplify the sentence.

ra. Illa qua properet ipse, ‘down stream)

13. Remis non adiuvetur. The current is so swift that oars are not
required, and indeed cannot be used with advantage. Both ‘adiuvetur’ and
superetur have the same nominative, namely Clitumnus, tbe river itseli,
which is now ia the writer’e thoughts though not expressed. Hence
vatidus and adversus cotue to be masc, and not nent.. in concord with
‘flumen'

15. Ut flexerint cuneum, viz. either up stream or down stream.

18. Adnumerut‚ ‘counts among its osen cbarms,' though os cnunc they
properly belonged to the dry land.

aa. Sortes. Lots were also in nse at Praeneste and Caere. At the
former place they consisted of sticks ol oak with characters graven on them.
cic. de Div. a. 41.

26. Quod ponte transmittitur, ‘which is crossed (by the visitor) by
means of a bridge.‘ ‘Transmittere flumen’ means to cross a river, for
although ‘mittere’ has dropped its original meaning and becomes intransitive,
='mitti,' yet the addition of ‘trans' enables it to govern an 'accusative
See Madvig, ξ ²²4· Since then ‘transmittit flumen' may mean ‘be crossen
a river,’ 'transmittitur flumen' may mean ‘a river is crossed (by him).’
Finally, the ablative ‘ponte' is thrown in to describe tbe means of nossing3
cp. ‘ln transgressu Euphratis quern ponte transmittebat' Tac. nnn. 15. 7.
Or it may be translated simply, ‘which is spanned by a bridge.’ This would
be a cormption of the proper use ol' ‘transmitte' paralleled by the arn·
biguous English idiom ‘to be crsssed bya bridge!

27. Inita etium uetere conoessum. The sanitary object of keeping
clean springs meant for use was attained under the religione pretext ol their
sanctity. This was thoronghly in the spirit of the Roman cult as iuterpreted
by Mommsen (vol. i. p. 184). Cp. the offence given by Nero's violatiou
of tbe much-prized ‘etqua Marcia' Tac. Anu. 14. 22.
