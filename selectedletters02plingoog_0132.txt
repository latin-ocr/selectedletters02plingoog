he thinks, a mere fsshion, the result of satiety and weariness, or, at best, of
false reasoning, not ot' political indignation and hopelessness. See Merivale’s
Hist. Emp. c. 62. =

Ep. 8. 1. stagnum proventum poetarum, ‘a great erup: or

‘abnndance, os poets.' The original use oi the word is of the growth
os corn, smits, or increase os animaist , ,
'Proventuque oneret sulcos, atque horrea vincat'
Virg. Georg. a. 518.

The number os persons who employed or amused themselves with literature
at Rome, in the tin're of Pliny, is very remarkable. The Roman nobles
were highly educated, and the jealousy of the Emperors, depriving the
aristocracy of active interest in public affairs, turned their thoughts the
more towards literary exertion. Almost every distinguished man among
them wrote either prosc or verse; and as the rememhranoe of freedom
, became iainter, the style oi these compositione improved in a certain arti·
ficial polish and exactness, while they became less vigorous and daring in
thought. Mr. Merivale contrasts in this respect the writings of the Fla-
vian age (am. 70-96) with those of the previous generations; Hist. Emp.
c. 54and c.64.

a. Quo non recitem aliquis. The subj. is the proper mood of
dependent relative clauses, (1) when a quality is to be expressed,'belonging
to the subject of the principal sentence, as ‘non is es qui gloriere;’ (a)
when it is stated that there is, or is not, something of which the relative
clause may be asserted, as ‘nemo est orator qni se Demosthenis similem
esse nolit' Cic. de Opt. Gen. Or. a. Madvig, ξς 364, 365.

It was the custom ol' poets and historiens at Rome to read their works
alond to a select circle of friends in their own homes, or to larger audiences
in public rooms hired for the purpose. Pliny makes frequent allusions to
these recitations, and considered it a duty of friendship to attend them. It
was not so usual to recite orations, and he excuses himself on one occasion
for thus reading a speech which he had previously delivered, in order to
profit hythe remarks of the hearers before publishing it. Bks.7.17and ·
8. ra. Juvenal speaks bitterly of the tedionsness of some os the poete (1.
1—13)3 and elsewhere ot' the interest felt when eminent authors, like
Statius, recited:

‘Curritur ad vocem iucundam et carmen amicae
Thebaidos, laetam fecit quum Statius urbem’
Juv. 7. 8².

3. Proferunt se, ‘bring themselves iorward.' Used hy Seneca of seli·
taught men, ‘quibus ex se ipsis impetus fuit, qui seipsos protulerunt’ Ep.
52. Also hy Pliny, ‘materiam se proferendi’ Ep. 77. 7, ‘an opportunity ior
bringing himself into notice) And by Tacitus, ⁴ Montanum, quia protulerit
ingenium extorrem agi' Ann. 16. 29.

Stationibus, places of public resort, sor conversation or amusement.
‘Domos stationesque circumeo’ Bk. a. 9.
