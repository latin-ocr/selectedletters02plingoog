kinds of cases tried before the ⁸ centumviri' They differed from the other
judges in being a definite body or ‘collegium’ and are said 10 have derived
their name from being chosen three from each 01 the thirty-five tribes,
making 105 originally. Augustus however enlarged the court, and 110011-
tained 180 judges. Very young men appear to have practised in it, and Pliny
complains 01 the way in which the pleadiugs were conducted. He however
continued to plead in it occasionally iu the time 01 Trajan, or perhaps later,
and was pleased with the crowded audientes which listened 10 him. Ep. ao

Ep. 13. 4. Praevnrioalio. Observe that ‘praevaricatio' is the predicate.
The word means the betrayal of bis cause by an advocate, and was used most
properly 01 the accuser, but also of the defendant. Pliny frequently uses 11
10 its proper sense, as in Blr. 3. 9 ‘Accidit enirn res contraria et nova,‘ut
accusatore praevaricationis damnato rea absolveretur? Cicero (Pam. 8. 11)
uses ‘praevaricator publicae causae' for one who culpably neglects public
interests. 11 is derived from ‘ varus,' and a ploughman who makes acrooked
furrow is said ‘ praevaricari‘ by Pliny the elder, who adds ‘inde translatum
hoc crimen in forum' H. N. 18. 49. Cp. expression borrowed from turf

cessful. He was born at Athens 11. 0. 458. Thirty-five 01 his orations are
extant, besides fragments of others. Of those 01 Cato, which were almost
equally numerous, only fragments remain. Cicero, who had read more than
150 01 them. praises thern highly, especially for vigour and weight, but says
that even in his time few persons read, 01 even knew them at all, and admits
a certain roughness 01 style in them. Brut. 17. Smitb’s Dict. Biog.
