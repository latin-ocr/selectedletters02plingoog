' bound to make for a child. This could hedone under‘LexFalcidia'in
any case where the natural heirs were not made at least ‘heredes ex quad·
rante,’ i. e. did not at least receive a fourth part of the inheritance. lf
Gratilla had made such a provision, Curianus would have had no ground for
action. Or again, she might have made him ‘heres ex asse‚’ but might
have exhausted the property by legacies out of it so as to leave him iu eii'ect
but one fourth of the whole. For this also he would have had no remedy.

34. Ex asse, ‘to the whole inheritance.’ ln divisions of property the
⁴ as’ was taken to represent the whole.

38. Biennium. Two years undisturbed possession gave the possessor
a title by ‘usus' to real property. Pliny's ‘coheredes' had enjoyed their
shares of the property as long as he had his, but notice of action had heeu
served ou them but not on him.

44. Antiquum. The word occurs in Cicero in the same good sense, but
Pliny's frequent arrd habitual use of it is characteristic of his mind, which
cluug to theold memoriesof the state, and the forms in which they survived.
Cp. Bk. a. 11. 18, where he couples ‘pulcrum’ with ‘antiquum’ The
parenthesis nisi forie, dcc. refers to ‘antiquum'

up. 45. 1. Turdus, fieldfares, which were not taken wild when in
season‚ but kept and fed for the table all the year round in ‘ornithoues.'
Even in Varro's time they were sold when fat for about three denarii apiece.

Parem caleulum, ‘which l cannot match in value.' The Romans
learnt to compute by the help of ‘ calculi,’ small stones placed in an ‘abacus’
or tray, with different cornpartments for umis. tens. and hundreds. Pliny
varies his use of the same metaphor of ‘calculi' in Bk. 2. 19, aud Ep. 9. ’
38. where see note.

a. Urbis oopus, ‘city commodities.’ His Laurentiue villa was only
seventeen miles from the city, so that it would be natural for him to send a
present of some city luxury to a friend residing further from Rome than
himself. The fact that Ostia was the usual marku-town of the villa (Ep. 21.
118) presents no real difficulty; aud the conjecture ‘ullis' for ‘urbis’ has no
Ms. authority.

4. sollertiam Diomedis. Diomede's advantageous exchange of his
own hrazen armour for the golden armour of Glaucus (Hom. ll. 6. 236) gave
rlse to the proverb χρύσεα χαλκείων.

up. 46. 4. veritate promptissimus. This abl.. unlike the two pre·
ceding ablatives, is ‘abl of respect.’ Natura and usu are ‘abl of the means·
‘Veritas' here means a true and accurate statement of the matter on which
he was consulted. There is no occasion or authority for reading ‘varietate'
with Gierig.

s 6. Prosecutus. See note ou Ep. 35. 4

7. Utoumque3 properly a relative coniunctiou meaning ‘however’ or
‘whenever,' and followed by a verb. But in this passage it stands alone
with an indefinite meaning. and is in fact an adverb. Like ‘quaudoque,’
‘utcumque’ reaches this indefinite sense by an ellipse, which may perhaps irs this
