to the same subject) the latest of the whole series to which a date can be
affixed.

11. Sine titulo, ‘without an epitaph.’ For this sense of ¹ titulus’ cp.

‘Titulique cupido
Haesuri saxis cinerum custodibus' Juv. 10. 243·

15. Pulso Vindice. Julius Vindex, propraetor of Gaul, rose against Nero,
having first offered the empire to Galba. Verginius commanding in upper
Germany marched against the insurgente, and his army engaged and defeated
them in spite of an agreement which is said to have been come to between
the generals on either side.

the empire which was offered to him. See on Ep. 16. 4.

6. Prisce iubes, the first words of the poem of Paulus.

7. ugo vero non iubeo. Pliny’s gentlemanly feeling was naturally
outraged by this vulgar witot Javolenus. Certain German critics have
thought fit to defend Javolenus. One of these critics (who was also a
lawyer) is thus amusingly answered by Gierig‚ ‘non carpit noster merita
lavoleni; id unum modo tradit, eum senem dubiae esse sanitatis. Et quis
tandem neget ICtos quoque nobiles, urgente senectute, huic naturae humanae
imbecillitati esse obnoxios.'
