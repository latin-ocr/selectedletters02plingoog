up. 2.-Some editors think that the book which Pliny allodes to in this
letter is a copy oia speech which he made before the Centumviri, the court
in which he pleaded in hehalf ot' Attia Viriola who claimed to inherit her
father's property. He mentions this speech in Ep. 62 ‘Dedimus vela
indignationi, dedimus irae, dedimus dolori: et in amplissime cause, quasi
magno mari, pluribus ventis sumus vecti.' His friends, he says, considered
this to hold the chief place among his speeches‚ as the De Coronat among
those ot' Demosthenes. Unt'ortunately‚ except the Panegyric on Trajan, we
have no specimen of Pliny's orations.

C. Licinius Macer Calvus is mentioned by Cicero (who was twenty-four
years older) as a young orator who would have been eminent lor eloquence if
he had lived, but he died in his thirty-fifth or thirty-sixth year. Cicero thought
his style exact and polished, but wanting in force, and fitted for aleamed
audience, notior the multitude. Pliny would hardly have joined him with
Demosthenes if he had agreed with this estimate; and Quintilian speaks of
it as appearing to many too unfavourable, since Calvus could be foreible as
well as elegant; ‘estet sancta et gravis oratio, et castigata, et frequenter
