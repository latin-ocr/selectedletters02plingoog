LETTERS OF C. PLINIUS G. SECUNDUS. 151

‘utilitates' gains. For the rule concerning plurals of substantives of abstract
meaning, see Madvig, ξ 50, Obs. 3.

16. Sine fructu posteritatis, without producing their legitimate fruit
of lasting farne, see on Ep. 16. 5.

17. Abierant. The ⁶ editio princeps’ substitutes ‘aruerunt' which would
suit the metapbor suggested by various parts of the passage; sucb as, in flore
primm maturuissent; sine fruens.

Euenos. In the case of those substantives which have more than one
plural form, tbe neuter form is usually confined to poetical use ; cp. ‘ostreae
ostrea‚’ and ‘sibili‚ sibila.’

Ep. 52. 1. Quaerere: cp. ‘quaerit patria Caesarem'' Hor. carm. 4.
δ’ Ῑ5·

Μ. Regulum: see on Ep. ²3· 4.

3. Quemvis non posset ediscere. Regulus wrote and prepared bis
speeches with great care, but never could quite get thern by beart, which
⁴spoiled their effect.

It will be worth while to examine the history of this passage as an instance
of the way iu which the text was corrupted for want of a close adherence to
MSS. The Medicean MS. read, for ‘posset ediscere‚' ‘posse te discere?
Catenaeus, an early editor, saw tbis would not do, and cutting ‘te' in two,
restored ¹ t' to the previous ‘ posse,’ and ‘ e' to the following ‘discere’ But not
content with this be introduced ⁸ d‚’ aud printed ‘quamvis non posset dedis-
cere! lle then removed the full stop, and took illud ipsum aud the following
sentence as the accusative of ¹ dediscere,’ introducing hopeless confusion, and
compelling the reader to take veniebat as an impersonal verb. This con·
fusion was perpetuated by Cortius, and all the inferior modern editions, e. g.
tbe Taucbnitz edition.

5. Circumlinebst; with paint.

10. Une dicentibus, ⁸ to the counsel engaged in the same case;' not,
‘on tbe same side.’

Libere tempora. Cu. Pompeius, by a law passed in bis third consul-
ship, defined the proportions of tirne to be allotted to the accuser and the
accused respectively. The enactment was primarily to regulate the trial of
Milo then about to take place, Ascon. Arg. Cic. pro Mil. The proportion

was apparently that of two to three, and was measured by ‘clepsydrae’ But ⁸

if tbe plaintiff or prosecutor asked for ‘libera tempora‚' unlimited time, then
the saure privilege was necessarily granted to the other side.

11. Audituros conrogabat. For Pliuy's opinion on the custom of
inviting or hiring au audience, cp. Ep. ao. 15.

12. Sub alterius invidis. Regulus bore all the odium attaching toa
protracted trial and a packed audience. Pliny reaped the advantages of
uurestricted tirne for bis oratory anda crowd of listeners, in the ntidst of
which be found binrself ‘caught' as be expresses it. lle bad not brought
thern, but there they were. Tbe remembrance of all this is what leads him
to look for Regulus, ‘quaerere Regulum,’ witha sort of half regret.
