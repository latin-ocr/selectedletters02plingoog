26. Hae paenuria colonorum. Since the 'coloni’ were inseparabls
from the soil, their condition affected the value of the estate.

30. Aliquid umen fenero. lle had some little money out at interest.
and therefore says above, ‘prope totus!

31. Non seoua ao mea. Cp. his letter to her, ‘Non¹ mehercule tarn
mea sunt qnae mea sunt, quarn quae tua’ Bk. 1. 4.

Ep. 34. a. Lex tabellaria. Cicero mentions four such leges, by which
vote by· ballot was gradually sanctioned in the various functione of the
comitia: namely, the election of magistrates, the indicia publica, and the
enactment and repeal of laws. The dates of these laws range between '139
and 107 mc. and Cicero pro Sest. 48, in speaking of the ‘ Lex Cassia.' confirms
what is here said of the contentione which the question called forth. When
the electiori of magistrates was transferred by Tiberius to the senate, the ballot
was laid nside till the date of this letter.

6. Contionum, open meetings, as opposed to legally constituted as-
semblies. ⁴

16. Sub quo militaveram military service was anecessary qualification

20. Annos mersabat, under the ‘leges annales,' which fixed the age

31. Ur in reciperatoriis iudiciis. ‘Reciperatores‚¹ generally three in

number, were appointed by the praetor to decide on some issue oi fact which r

required no knowledge of law; Sigonius de lud. 1. 22. Hence there was

no reason against these being picked out on the spot from persons present in ¹
court, instead of being taken from a fixed list as the ‘iudices’ were. So ’

we find Cicero. Verr. a. 3, 59 and 60, complaining oi Verres for not naming

‘reciperatores de conventu! The point of comparison between the senate on Τ

this occasion and ‘reciperatores’ lies in the words repente apprehensi.

pp. 35. 1. necessisse. We have reason to believe that Martial lived ’

till the close of the year 100 ab.
3. Fertis. ‘bile’ the emblem of bitterness. Pliny seems to have in his

mind Martial's own criticism, Mart. 7. 25, which enumerates the same ingre· ¹

dients‚ ‘sal‚’ ‘fel‚' and ⁴ candor,' as necessary for epigrams that were meant to
beread.

Candoris. kindness oi heart. Ovid credits Salanus with ‘candor' for
his synrpathy with him in his exile, although their acquaintance was but
slight. Ov. Pont. a. 5. 5. Sincerity was not necessarily implied in the
word, and indeed candour, in the English sense, could not possibly have been
attributed to the sycophant Martial.

4. Prosecutus erem. ‘Prosequor' is only twice used in these letters in

the sense ‘to accompany,' but very frequently in its idiomatis sense, ‘to

compliment with,' followedby such ablatives as ‘libello‚’ ⁴ legatis,' ⁸ suffragio!
