to rear them in hope of receiving assistance. lt was not merely a provision
for orphans, though they may have been included in its benefits. See
Merivalo, Hist. Emp. c. 63.

8. Longo pluris, worth a great deal more than five hundred thousand
sestertii.

Actori publi003 the cieri< who received and disbursed the revenues
of a city, just as the ‘actores privati' did in the case of private estates. Cp.

Messeniani, ‘l conveyed.’ lt was not a real sale, as Pliny only handed
it over in order to receive it back ·

9. moena milis. He thus established a perpetual rent-charge on this
portion oi his estate amounting to thirty thousand sestertii. This made
exactly the same provision for the charity at Comum as a direct gift of a
capital (‘sors’) of five hundred thousand sestertii would have done. For
the interest os that sumat the usual rate of one-half per cent. per mensem, or
six per cent. (‘semissium usura’)‚ would have amounted to the same sum,
thirty thousand sestertii per annum.

We have in this matter another instance of Pliny's clearsightedness,
parallel to that noticed on Ep. 39. The deterioration and even absolute loss
of charitable and educational landed endowments in this country is familiar
to all students ol local history. Pliny’s scheme seems free from all objecdon,
as it was calculated to insure the safety os the endowment without breaking
up his own estate. ‘Vectigales agri’ were recognised by the Roman law:
the lessees had a right to retain the land so long as they paid the charges
due, and this right iu the land could probably be disposed of by will. At
any rate, in the conclusion of the letter Pliny seems to contemplate the land
as remaining in his disposition. though lowered in value by more than the
amount of the charge on it. from the fact of its being ⁴ vectigalis?

16. Diligentius muneri suo consulere. ‘to be more careful for the
security of one's gift than the interests of one's property.’ ‘Se' and ‘suus’

subject preceding) in the signification, of‘one's self,’ 'one’s own,' Madvig,

16. Messio Uaro. The share of this man iu the death of Helvidius is
alluded to in a previous letter, where he is made to speak of Senecio as one
os his victims, ‘mei mortui’ Bk. 1. 5.

17. Commentarios3 the diaries and note-books of Helvidius. Caesar
gave this name of ‘commentaries’ to his works ‘quod nudi essent omni
ornatu orationis’ Cic. Brut. 75.

21. Abolitos senatus (tonstallo. Cp. ‘Non in ipsos modo auctores
