Prope publici operis. lt almost rivalled the splendid works of this
kind which then existed in the Forum and Campus. The ‘cryptoporticus' of
this villa seems to have run out from it at right angles ou its north or north-
westem side, and to have been carried on parallel with the coast¹ which mey
be supposed to have run frour N.W. to SE. The Xystus lay between it
and the sea, and on thepinland side was the garden. lt could not well have Ι
been on the south-eastem side, as we are told above that that was appropri-
ated to the slaves. ·

74. Alternis, ‘altemately’ The meaning seems to be that the windows
towards the sea were in groups of two or three (⁸ plures '); that the oppo-
site wall had but single windows corresponding to these groups, and even
these single windows were not opposite to each group, but only to every
other group.

77. xystus, a terrace with flowerbeds and omameutal shrubs. Vitruvius
notices the different senses of the word in Greek sud Latin respectively.
’Ξυστόι enim Graeca appellatione est porticus empla latitudine in qua
athletae per hiberna tempora exercentur. Nostri autem hypaethrus ambu-
lationes xystos appellant' Vitr. 6. 10. The name is derived from the
smooth floor, giro.

89. I'n eapite xysti deinceps cryptoporticum ‘at the head of the
terrase and then at the head of the covered valk! ‘Cryptoporticus' is a

gen. govemed by‘in capite.' The terrase and portico were parallel and ,
conterminum, both being closed by the wall of the ginden-house (horu ¹

diceba), which cut straight across them. ‘Deinceps ⁹ iu this passage means
little more than ‘deinde’ and has not its usual sense of ‘ oue after another.²
91. Heumamrnus, a soom exposed on every side to the sun, and
therefore suitable for winter use without artificial warmth.
93. zotheca. This name was originally applied to cages or closets for
keeping fatted poultry. Hence it was transferred to small rooms for purposes
of study or retirement.

96. A temo villse; those of which he speaks below, ‘nunc continua. ³

· nunc intermissa tecta villamur!
roa. Andron, sn alley or passage running between the wall of the bed·
chambcr and that of the garden. An ‘andron ’ in the Greek sense would, of

course, have been far from contributing to the quiet of the room. This i

word, like ‘xystus’ above, isnoticed by Vitr. 6. ro, as having acquired a
different sense in the phraseology of Roman architecturc.

109. Abesse. This suite of rooms was removed from thevilla by the
whole length of the ‘cryptoporticus’

rra. Haeo utilius, sc. ‘villae'

114. Sunt enim in summo, ‘for they are surfaoe springs! ‘Putei' were

wells in which the water lay deep: hut the shallow wells here described were ἵ

properly called ‘fontes' The substantive ‘summum’ is frequently used fue

the suriaee of water, and here for the surface of the ground in which the
water appears.
