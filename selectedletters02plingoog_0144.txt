bestowed! Th'us, in reference to statues, Ep. 26. a, ‘expressum’ may almost
be translated ‘hold' Again in Ep. 48. ro, where the metaphor is from
pointing, ‘expressius ad exemplar‚’ ‘more vividly true ro the original!

as the audience were by the pleaders. This, though illegal, was most frequent.

17. sportulae. This word was now applied to any kind of gratuity for
