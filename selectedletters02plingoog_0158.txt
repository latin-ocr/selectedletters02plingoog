LETTERS OF G. PLINIUS 0. SECUNDUS. 141

nn. ³8. 1. Adsumo te ln consilium: a technical phrase, used
especially of the imperial ‘consiliarii' See on Ep. 4²· 1.

3. sollicitant: here as elsewhere=·alllciuut,' which seems to point to a
community of derivation for the two words, either real or supposed.

4. Iungendi. Cp. ‘Si Libyam remotis Gadibus iungas’ Hor. φᾶ. a. 2,
10.
6. Procuratore. One steward would be quite sufficient, and fewer
'sub-agents’ or ‘clerks’ ‘actores’ would be required for contiguons estates,
than for such as lay entirely separate from each other. There is no mention
ofa ‘villicus’ or farm-bailiff, as this estate seems not to have been farmed
by the owner, but let out to ‘coloni'

7. Unum villam colere. lt would be sufficient to have a house of
residence, ‘villa urbana,' on one of the two estates. The other might
simply be lrept up as a ‘villa rustica’ for the habitation of agents and slaves.

9. Atriensium the ‘atriensis' and the slaves under him had to keep ln
order the house and -furniture ¹

ruptariorum, fancy gardeners, whose art consisted in training and
dipping into shapes and patterns (‘ litteras quae nomen domini dicunt;’
‘bestiarum effigies· Bis 5. 6) those evergreen plants which then formed the
chief ornaments of Italian gardens. Cp. ‘topiarium laudavi: ita omnia
convestit hedera qua basim villae, quae intercolumnia ambulationis ut,‘ &o
cic. ad QF. 3. 1. See Becker’s Gallus, Exc. a, Sc. 5.

17. Μ sm, timber for buildlug. not wood for fuel; in which sense
always ‘li ,¹ from ‘lego ’ or ‘ ligo.’ ,

2ο. Pigriors, the farm stock, live or dead. on which distraint was
made, Thli would include the slaves belonging to the ‘coloni’

Reliqua, arrears.

23. Instruenui ; ⁸ they therefore (the ‘coloni,') must be provided with
slaves at so much higher a price than usual, because good slaves? The
‘coloni' though attached to the land, and themselves to some ,extent under
servile disabilities, were nevertheless tenants paying rent and possesslng
property of their own in stock and slaves. See Smith’s Dict. Ant. art.
‘Colonusss and Daubeny's Roman Husbandry, Lect. 2.

Quod frugi. Pliny has no ‘servi vineti’ to give thern. This class
of slaves being untrustworthy worked ln fetters and were conlined in a sort
of prison. He must therefore buy ‘servi soluti’ of good character, and
these will eost a great deal, and add greatly to the expense of entering upon
the property.

25. Sestertio hriolos. Amillion of sesterces is regularly expressed by
‘decies centena millia sestertium‘ (llbbreviated gen. plur. for ‘sestertiorum.’)
But instead of this we commonly find the abbreviated expression, ‘decies ses·
tertium’ (generally reversed, ¹ sestertium decies ³), and so on for larges numbers.
lu such expressions ‘sestertium' which is properly a gen. plur.. is treated as
aneutersubst.sing. Madvig,Suppl. 2. From this imaginary subst. we here
have 'sestertio’ abl. of price.
