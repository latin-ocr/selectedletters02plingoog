Ep, 69. 1. Historiae tuae. The trial of Massa would come within
the scope of the ‘historiae' of Tacitus properly so called. lt occurred in
the reign oi Domitian about the time of Agricola's death, as we learn from
Tac. Agr. sub fin. ‘Massa Baebius iarn turn reus erat.' But inasmuch as
the exmnt portion oi the ⁸ Histories' does not bring us further than the
midst of the reign of Vespasian, we have no means of kuowing whether
Pliny's wish was gratified, though we do know that his presentiment was
disappointed.

3. Ab optimo quoqne artifice. The whole letter is an imitation of
Cicero's letter to Lucceius the historian urging a similar request, Cic.
Fam. 5. rs. Even the illustration from art occurring here is borrowed from
Cicer03 cp. ‘Neque enim Alexander ille gratiae causa ab Apelle potissimum
pingi et aLysippo fingi volebat; sed quod illosum artem enm ipsis tum etiam
sibi gloriae iore putabat!

7. 1n publicis eolla, the daily gaaette pnblished' at Rome under the
empne, otherwise known as ‘acta diurna: or 'diuma’ These gazettes are
spoken ofas being read in the armies and the provinces, Tac. Anu. 15. aa.

10. Herennio Senecione. put to death hy Domitian on various
charges, one oi them that oi having composed the liic oi Helvidius Priscus,
Ep. 67. 14. Tacitus pays a tribute to his integrity, ‘'nos innocenti sanguine
Senecio perfudit’ Tac. Agr. snb iio.

11. Provinciae Baeticae, Andalusia, the southernmost province of
Spain. It derived its nante from the river Baetis (Ghadalquivir) which
traverses it frons east to west. it is cut off from inland Spain by the Sierra
Morena, and open only on its south-uestem coast. This lact explains its
connection with Africa under the Empire (cp. ‘ Pnscus ex Baetica ex Africa
Classicus’ Bk. 3. 9.) and also, later, under the Vandals and the Moors.
The province seems to have been unlucky in its rulers. Twice after the
trial oi Massa they cause to Rome with accusations against Classicus,
and against Gallus. in the case of Classicus they prevailed on Pliny to
appear ior them again, Blr. 3. 4, and ihe trial is related at length in the
ninth letter oi the same book. In the case of Gallus he resolved to
remain neutral.

, ta. Ut bona eius publiea eumodtrentun this was to be done in
order that restitution might be made out of thern to the provincials.

16. Ne bona dissipari alnam quornm esse ln custodia debant,
‘that they (the oonsuls) would not allow the property to be made away
with. in charge of which they ought to be.' The antecedent os ‘quorum'
is ‘bona’ not 'consules’ nor ‘ab iis’ understood. Either oi the latter
antecedente makes the position of ‘esse' between ⁸ quorum‘ and ‘ in custodla'
extremelypharsh and uunatural. li, on the other hand, ‘esse in custodia·
be considered as one phrase all is smooth. This explanation (so lar as l
arn aware, original) is supported by ‘cum in eiusdem anni custodia te atque
