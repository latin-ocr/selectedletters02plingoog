Ep. 59. 1. Amineuli mei. For an account of the life and studies of
Pliny the elder, see Ep. 25.

to occiderit, denoting the cause os Pliny's death.

Ut populi, ub urbes, ¹ as nations and cities did (i. e. perish).’ Prob-
ably this refers to Herculaneum and Pompeii, whose inhabitants are with some
affectation styled ‘populi' Some commentatore have understood the passage

Whatever the Liburnica was, it is at any rate here contrasted with the larger
quadriremes, which are launched when the voyage is changed (vertit ine
consilium) from purposes of curiosity to those of succour.

Misenum, and looking north-west.

Erat, sc. Pomponianus.

44. Dicemptus sinu medio, ‘separated’ from Pliny by the bay which
