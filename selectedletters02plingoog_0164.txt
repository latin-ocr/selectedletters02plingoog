LUTTERS OF Ο. PLINIUS C. SECUNDUS. 147

with Catullus at the ‘Council of the Turbot,' see below, and he still sat in
the senate under Trajan, Ep. 77. 64.
16. huminibus orbatus. Ἴ
‘Et curn mortifero prudens Veiento Catullo
Qri nunquam visae flagrabat amore puellae' Juv.4.113.

23· Nobiscum censeret. The moderatiori which Nerva prescribed to
himself in regard to this great criminal seems to have marked his dealings
with the class (cp. Ep. 77); and the victims of the delators were probably
little satisfied with the amount of favour which they (the delators) expe·
rienced from him. Merivale, Hist. Emp. c. 63.

up. 43. 1. scripseram tibi, viz. in Ep. 54.

6. Iratum prinoipem. ‘Iratum’ is the predicate.

7. Fefellit. Cp. ‘Nec vixit male qui vivens moriensque fefellit' Hor.
Ep.1.17.ro. '

9. In senatu. The emphasis ison these words.

up. 44. 1. Legatum mihi obvenit. This is that legacy of Curianus
which is mentioned towards the close of the letter. It gave Pliny satisfaction
because it was a recognition of his honourable conduct in regard to the former
legacy, that of Galla, the story of which he proceeds to relate first.

6. Praeiudicio, ‘by my first giving judgment in his favour.’ An
opinion given and acted upon by Pliny would have great weight in the
centumviral court, in which he was a distinguished pleader. This sense of
‘praeiudicium’ is quite distinct from the technical sense which it sometimes
has of ‘a previous trial to clear the way for the determination of the main
rssues’

9. Non satis honestum too like the conduct of a ‘captaton’ a
legacy-hunter. .

14. Minorem, in moral worth. lf Curianus could trust to Pliny’s
honour to judge his own case, why should Pliny distrust himself?

16. Secundum, ‘in favour of‚' for the validity of the will.

aa. Consili13 ie. Pliny and his two assessors.

24. Cum ueteris subscripsit. Those who brought an action, both
plaintiff and counsel, were required to put their names to the notice of
actiou; hence ‘subscribere iudicium’ or ‘subscribere’ mean to go to law
with a man. ‘Subscribere oum ceteris’ is an unusual construction, to be
explained by the sense of the word which=‘certare.’ ‘Certare’ could of
course be constructed with ‘cum’ and abl. Elsewhere we find ‘subscribere
in aliquem' Cic. Qu. 3. 3, or a dative following, ‘cras subscribam homini
dicam’ Plaut. Paen. 3. 6, 5.

²5· Centum-virale iudicium: see note on Ep. 12. 9. ' 9

30. Gratillae amicitia. Domitian had killed Rusticus, and banished
his wife Gratilla. Notorious intimacy with them might have exposed the
litigatore to a like fate.

32· Ex parte quarta. Curianus sought to have his mothcr‘s will set
aside as ‘inofficiosum' wanting in that provision which a parent is morally
