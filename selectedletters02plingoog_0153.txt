Ep. ao. 7.

8. cedentes, ‘recedentes a fronte.⁸

Ieio, ‘in your direction.’

26. ud paucos dies. ‘Ad' with the accus. would naturally fix the
date oi his coming, ‘after a few days,’ ‘in a few days time3' cp. ‘ad
praefinitum diem' Ep. 63. 10, ‘ad decem annos ¹ Cic. Att. 5. a. But the
context forbids this sense. It must mean ‘for a few days stay‚' and is a
, careless expression which may be explained in either of two ways. It may
be an abbreviation for ‘ad paucos dies commorandum,’ in which case
‘ad’ will really belong to a suppressed gerund; or. as seems more probable‚
the words ‘ad paucos dies: 'up to, as long as, a few days,’ are thrown iu as
though he had written them ‘adfuturum’ instead of ¹ venturum.’

14. Maiore oure quam ingenio. Merivale takes this as the mort·
of the literature of what he calls the ‘Flavian period! ‘Silius writes witt
all the principles of art in his head, and all the works of the great modes
ranged in order round his desk' Hist. Enrp. c. 64.

18. ttovt principie, Traian, who had received at Cologne, nm. 98, tle
news ol his accession, but did not enter Rome till more than a year hd
