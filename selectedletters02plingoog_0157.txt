cuius in gremio. The meaning is, ‘you who could bear to survive
your husband’s death.¹ The disjointed mode ol expression, et vivis, is
a witness to the genuineness of the words.

38. Filiam tuem mori meeum. Tweuty-four years later, as Thrasea
ioresaw, a decision had to be made on this point, which resulted in bis
persuading Arria the younger to survive him tor the sake of their daughter
F annia; Tac. Ann. 16. 34.

45. Imperia. Pliny's admiration for this ferocious attempt forms a

pendant to Seneca's observatiort, Ep. 7ο, iu which, among anecdotes os hideous ,

suicides, he remarks, ‘eui difficilis occasio (mortis) est, is proximam quamque
pro optima arripiat, sit lic'et inaudita, sit nova.’

such as stood on the rock of Capreae, Suet. Tib. 74.

‘epistolae’ were not written on ‘codicilli;' -‘ adeo tecum sum, ut dubitem, an
incipiam non epistolas, sed codicillos tibi scribere’ Seu. Ep. 55 sub tin.
‘Epistolae' were therefore probably written on paper whenever it was

. unlikely that the tablet would be returned. So we fiud Pliny using paper,

15. Libellos, bills publicly circulated as opposed to private notes of
invitation. ln the dialogue de Oratoribus, attributed to Tacitus, the giver

33. Eae severitate aurium'laetor. Here is the result of Quintilian's
reaching. Pliny. like his master, earnestly desired to bring about a reform in
the public taste, hitherto devoted to the stilted and florid rhetoric iu which
Seneca and Lucan excelled. The criticism ou Seneca, Qrint. Inst. Or. to. 1, is
the best comment on this passage, and is as well worth reading as the rest oi
that celebrated chapter.

such as panegyric. The double regimen of ‘ decedere' is ttncomnron, though
its use iu these two senses, ‘to make way for,' and ‘to retire from,' with the
dat. and abl. severally, is common enough. Cp. 'sanctis decedere Divis'
Cat. Pel. 62 ς ‘decedere instituto suo' Liv. 37. 54.
