LETTERS OF 0. PLINIUS 0. SECUNDUS. 173

were ready to die of mere obstinacy, a passage referred to and explained in
Smith's Dict. Bible, vol. a, p. 857 note, art. ‘Philosophy’ .
Pliny could only see in the conduct of the Christians the violatiou of the

most evident duty, that os passive obedieuce on the part oi subjecta towards
a beneficent governruent.

16. 111 urbem remittendos: ep. Acts 25. ra.

17. reso mactatu . . . . crimine, ‘when as usually happens, the charge
became ruore common, simply from the fact ol the matter being dealt with.'
‘Crimen' is the charge of being a Christian, which now presented itsell as
an easy means of gratifying private eumity, even when there was no evidence
to bring iu support of it.

·aa.'1'uae ac vino supplicarent Christians who consented to do
this were known in the Church as ‘ thurificati! cp. Cyprian, Ep. 52.

Male dicerem Christo. It was a similar command which about
fifty years later dresv from Polycarp his dying confession,‘1 hare now served
hirn eighty-air years, and he has done meno wrong; how can Ι blaspheme
my Kiug and Saviouri'

23. Quorum nihil cogi. Verbs which, like ‘cogo’ take a double
accusative iu the active voice may retain one os those accusatives in the
passive. Thus, since

‘Quid non neonalia pectora cogis
Auri sacra fames? Virg. Aen. 3. 56,
is good syntax, then ‘si cogi aliquid consules possunt' Liv. 4. 26, will also
stand as cod.

30. Rhabo die, namely the first day oi the weelr. This account of the
Christian worship corresponds with that given by Justin Martyr, not quite
thirty years later, who mentione assemblies sor the purpose of worship as
being held ry* τοῦ ἡλίου λεγομένῃ ἡμόρᾳ Apol. 1. 87,
¹ 31. Ante lucem, before the labours ol the day began, which irs the case
οἱ slase Christiana would occupy Suuday aa much aa any other day. Thus
this early hour became the established time t'or worship, and consequently
for the administration of the Holy Communion. The same hour is still
regarded as proper for that purpose, an example of how the necessities ot' an
age establish a custom which long survives that age aud its necessities. '

German, not necessarily either lengthy or metrical. All that ‘cannen'
implies is ‘a sat iorm oi words)

Quasi de0; these words are evidently thrown in by Pliny, and must ’
not be regarded as evidence of the belief ol the Choreb at that time in the
Divinity ol Christ,

32. Sacramenta. Waterland, ln tracing the history of the various
names oi the lord's Supper, refers to this as the earliest application to it of
the name ‘sacrament’ ‘As Pliny is here reportiug what the Christiane had
told him, it is reasonable to judge'that they made use oi the word “ sacrament’'
to him, which they understood in the Christian sense, however Pliny or
Trajan might take it' Waterland on the Eucharist, c. 1.
