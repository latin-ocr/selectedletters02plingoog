112 NOTES.

quam solebas; neque minus haec tamen tua gravissimi sermonis lenitas,

quam illa summa vis et contentio probatur* Cic. de Or. 1. 60. ‘Con-
tentiosa oratio,’ Bk. a. lo, is different, and means a contentione speech.

12. ληκύθους, lit. ilasks sor oil or artists’ colours. Hence λήκυθοι and
the Latin equivalent ‘ampullae' were used for rhetorical ornaments and
exaggerations which writers and speakers employed to deck their language.
Cp. Cic. Att. 1. 14, and Hor. Ep. 6. 3, 14. Pliny calls these ornaments
Murci nostri ληκύθους because Cicero in the passage quoted had consessed
to their use.

14. Neoeatquod putes. Arrianus is not however to think that, because
he makes this stipulation in favour of omament‚ he therefore wants ‘venia'
instead ot' ‘emendatio’

15. Quo magis intendam limem tuam, ‘that l may urge you to more
searching criticism ;’ lit. ‘that l may give more force to your file? ‘Lima'
is a common metaphor for care in polishing verse or prose. Martial
(speaking of Pliny's criticism on his book) says,

‘Quem censoria cum rneo Severo
Docti lima momorderit Secundi’ Mart. 5. 80.

17. mortuae errori nostro, ‘what is perhaps my folly‚’ namely his in·
tention to publish.

18. Album caleulum adiicere, ‘to approve' Cp.

‘Mos erat antiquis niveis atrisque lapillis.
His damnare reos, illis absolvere cnlpae'
Ov. Met. 15. 41.
sip. 3. 1. Subur-bunum, sc. ‘rus vel praedium?

3. Euripus. This name, specially applied to the strait between Euboea
and Boeotia, was used both in Greek and Latin ol any narrow canal or conduit‚
though Cicero implies that in his time this nse was thought grandiloquent.
‘Ductus vero aquarum, quos isti nilos et euripos vocant’ Cic. Leg. a. 1.

4. Serviane tanus. ‘Serviens’ carries out the metaphor of subieotue.
llere it means ‘yielding itself to the view,’ and so seraing to enhance the
attractions of the villa. Cp. ‘Piscinam quae fenestris seivit et subiacet' Bk.
5. 6, and ‘Diversis servit sua terra fenestris' Stat. Silv. a. a, 75.

5. Gestatio. This was an avenne sor exercise on horseback‚ in a
carriage, or in a litter. It was sometimes covered. Cp.

‘Porticus in qua
Gestetur dominus quoties pluit' Juv.7.178.

6. Triclinia ills. popularia. illa paucorum. ‘those dining-rooms for
large parties, and the others for small ones' ‘Triclinium' was extended to
mean the room for dining in, as well as the couch for dining on. ‘Popularia'

in this sense is justified hythe similar use of ¹ populns' simply to express a ¹

large number. Cp. ‘Populo natorum . . . meorum‚' Ov. Met. 6. 198, quoted
b ’ '.

yylllgiagsmdentne ta. sc. cubicula. He means, ‘ do you stay at home and
only move from the blue bed to the brown l'
