LETTERS OF C. PLINIUS G. SECUNDUS· 119

the works of Saturninus than may be gathered from this letter, but there are
epistles addressed to him, Bk. 5. 21; 7. 7 and 155 9. 38.

5. Sive meditata sive subite proferret, ‘whether he spoke from
preparation or extempore.’

6. Aptae crebraeque sententiae. ‘Sententia' had a technical meaning
in writers upon style, and is defined hythe author of the treatise ‘ad
Herennium' (c. a) as ‘Oratio sumpta de vita, quae aut quid sit, aut quid
esse oporteat in vira; breviter ostendit‚’ hence the phrase ‘maxima senten.
tiarum‚' ‘a maxim! Quintilian classes fsententiae’ among the ‘lumina' of
a speech, aud from his examples it appears that he means not only general
maxims, but other pointed sayings‚ brielly expressed. The orators of this
age, he says, were too fond of filling their speeches with these ‘sayinga.'
which should he more sparingly used. 'Ego vero haee lumina orationis
velut oculos quosdam esse eloquentiae credo. Sed neque oculos esse toto
corpore velim, ne caetera membra officium suurn perdant: et, si necesse sit,
veterem illum horrorem dicendi malim, quam istam novam licentiam. Sed
patet media quaedam via’ Qrint. 8. 5.

7. Antiqua: opposed to modern or newly coined words. The older
words were considered more expressive (propria) than modern ones; as the
use of words of Saron origin in English instead of those of Latin origin is
thought a markos vigour.

9. Sl retraelentur, ‘if they should be afterwards read ς’ literally,
‘handled again? The orations of Pompeius were pleasant both to hear and
read.

13. contionibus‚speeches related (orinvented) inhishistory; orationi-
bus, those which he himself delivered in pleading.

14. Pressior . . . . adductiore, ‘more brief, compressed, and concise'

16. catullus eut calvus. For Calvus asan orator, see note on Ep. a. 5.
Nothing but a few small fragments of hia poems remain: but in spite of
Horace’s sneer,

‘Nil praeter Calvum et doctus cantare Catullum'
Sat. 1. ro. ¹9·
they were highly esteemed hythe ancients for grace and wit.

Catullus was a contemporary of Calvus, having been born at Verona, five
years before him, nc. 87.

18. Data opera. ‘on purpose!

ar. Metro solutum ; i. e. they had the elegance of Plautus or Terence,
without the mette.

aa. eui illa etat componat, ⁴ because he either compotes thern 0r‚' &e
The subjunctive in the relative proposition expresses the reason.

25. Antequam scribam. The subjunctive is found with ‘antequam' in

speaking ofa thing which usually happens before something else. ‘Qui .
quotidie antequam pronuntient, vocem excitant' Cic. de Or. 1. 59. So
‘antequam scirem’ may be explained in the second line of this letter.

Madvig, ξ 360 c.
