152 noras,

18. Binas vel singulos. ln the trial of Marius Priscus (Bk. a. 11)
Pliny spoke through sixteen clepsydrae, and his speech lasted nearly five
hours. As that trial took place in 'January, these five hours would be
equivalent to about four hours of our time. See note on Ep. 25. 28. Hence
‘binas vel singulas' would be ‘halt' an hour or a quarter of an honr apiece.'

29. Fidei, to the obligation of their duty to their clients.

39. Communium. This is the MSS. reading, but ‘communia' in the
sense oi ‘public interests' is unparalleled. The earliest editors seem to have
either ielt the difficulty or to have had another reading before thern. as they
insert ‘civium' Mommsen's emendation ‘amore communi omnium’ is
probable, and it is easy to imagine that the two latter words may have run
into one.

Emendori cupere quoe iem corrigere difficile est. Why
‘emendare’ is spoken of as easier than ‘corrigere' may be seen by consider-
ing the metaphors involved in them. lt isa less matter to remove a few
blemislves (‘mendae'), than to straighlen throughout a thing which has
grown crooked.

41. Mihi nutem3 this sentence explains to Arrianus why he is to take
‘no news‚' novi nihil, for ‘good news.’

Ep) 53. Pliny practised what Cicero preached, ‘nutrices et paedagogi

iurevetustatis plurimum benevolentiae postulabunt' Cic. Lael. ao. Nurses have ¹

their place both in the epic and the tragic poetry of Greece aud Rome.

Ep. 54. 3. In campanium, perhaps to Baiae. Pliny the elder describes r

the whole coast as possessing ‘ vitalis ac perennis salubritas!
Ε· vestigio, ‘immediately’
6. nequid denique. Pliny is anxious to know il his wife is enjoying
the delights of Campania without being retarded in her recovery by indul·
gence in them.

7. 'I'ransmitho means tolet go by one, yet not so as to miss or neglect. .

By zeugma it is here joined to both ‘ secessus’ and ‘voluptates'

ΕΡ. 55. 6. Omnium quae decucurri candidatus, ‘candidate for

all the offices which l have successively enjoyed.' Compounds oi ‘curro'

may either retain or drop the augment. Cp. ‘decursu honorum‘ Cic. de Or. ³

1. 1.

12. Quintilianum: see on Ep. 20. 34.

13. Vontitabst=ipolrcu

15. In senatu, where the magistrates were now elected, the result oi the
election being announced to the people who continued to meet for this
purpose long after the loss of their power to elect. The electioris retained
their original name of ‘comitia' which properly belonged to the popular
assembly. Cp. ‘E campo comitia ad patres translata sunt' Tac. Anu. 1. 15.
This change was made under Tiberius.

²4· Cum fratre, probably Julius Avitus, whose death is lamented in Ep. 51.

28. Sumagio meo. On the importance oi influential ‘suffragatores’
see ou Ep. 40. ar.
