LETTERS ΟΡ O. PLINIUS 0. SECUNDUS. 133

so composed as to accord with what is here said of Spurinna. See
Wernsdorf’s Poet. Lat. Min, vol. 5.

26. Gratiam cumulat. This makes it probable that Spurinna's verses
were somewhat free in their tone. Elsewhere (Bk. 4. 14) we find that Pliny
considered such ireedom not only consistent with purity of life, but also, as

· it were, an agreeable relief.

²7 Nuntiata est; a slave watched the ‘solarium' or the ‘clepsydra'
and announceu the expiratiou of each hour.

29. Movetun pils; as was usual before bathing. Old men commonly
played with the ‘fodis’ a larges and lighter bail, requiring less exertion than
the‘pila.'

34. Puro, ‘puinss without ornament. Spurinna¹s simple and relined
taste preferred this to the more admired ‘caelatum’ or 'asperum argentum)
See Becker's Gallus, Sc. a. u. 12.

35. corinthia; vessels made of the rare and costly Corinthian bronze.
Even Pliny had nothing in his villa of this material, and when be bought a
‘Corinthium signum,’ placed it in a temple as ‘dignum deo donum' Ep. 26. 17.
The secret of manufacturing Corinthia had long been lost, hence their salue.

Adfloibur3 a word of strong emotion, here contrasted with the
moderate pleasure signified by ‘delectatun’ Cp. ‘delectare oculos im·
peritorum' Ep. 26. 12.

36. comoedis. We have frequent mention in these letters of entertain-
ments performed during dinner. At some houses ballet dancers (‘Gaditanae’)
were introduced, Ep. 10. 8; or clowns (⁶ scurrae vel moriones ') strayed about
the room, Bk. 9. 17. But persons of a higher taste, such as Pliny aud his
friends, diverted themselves with more instructive amusements, ‘ut voluptates
quoque studiis condiantur! They resorted to standard authors, from which
history was read by the ‘lecton' po'etry sung to music hythe ‘lyristes’ or
some passage of comedy rendered memoriter by the ‘comoedus’ Chosen
slaves were trained for these several duties. Cp. for ‘lecton' Cic. Fam. 5. 9 ;
for‘comoedus,'1ip. 50. 8. ’

up. 25. 3. Indicis partibus. The words ‘titulus’ and ‘indere' with
reference to books, have two distinct senses. It cannot be said that the one
sense is always represented by ‘titulus,’ aud the other by ‘iudom' but at
. least the meanings themselves are clearly separate, by whichever name either
may be designated. There was first the title written on the strip of paper
or parchment, and affixed to the outside of the roll, and this was usually
called ‘titulus ;' secondly, there was the table of contents, found in some
books, written inside the book, probably at the beginning, and this is the
usual sense oi ⁸ iudex,’ or ‘indices' Such were the indices composed by
Pliny the elder for his Natural History, and by Gellius for his Noctes Atticae.
lt is easy to see that from such an index of the contents of one book might
grow an index describing, as in this letter, sil the works of one author, or
even an index of the works of various authors of the same class, such as
that alluded to by Seneca, ‘sume in manus indicem philosophorum’ Seu. Ep.
