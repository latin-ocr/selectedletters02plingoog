4- Rescripto. By this time the word ‘rescriptum' had attained a
technical sense, viz. an answer in waiting given by the emperor to some
magistrate or private person consulting him, which when given carried the
force of law. At a later period (in the institutes of Justinian) it was held
that whatever the emperor determined by letter (⁸ rescriptum ¹), or decided
judicially (‘ decretum'), or declared'by edict (‘edictum'), was the law of the
empire. These three classes of decisione were' included under the general
name ‘constitutiones' These ‘constitutiones' were preserved in the imperial
archives even from the time of Augustus, and copies of thern ruore or lesa
complete were also to be found at the scats of provincial goverument. Α

careful discrimination was observed between those constitutions which were ’

ol universal and those which were of special application. cp. ‘Aut proprium
aut universale' Ep. 87. 4.

ro. Duobus matrimoniis meis. lt appears to be uncertain whether
Pliny was married once or twice before his marriage with Calpurnia. We
know from Ep. 77. aa aud 65 that the wife who immediately preceded
Calpurnia died shortly after the accession of Nerva, aud that her step-father's
name was Vettius Proculus. Pompeia Celerina, whom Pliny speaks of as
his ‘socrus' (Bk. 1. 4), was probably the mother of this previous wife, and

therefore had married Vettius Proculus as her second husband. See ou 1

¹ We are then wholly without trace of a marriage on Pliny’s part previous i

to that with the daughter of Pompeia Celerina. Mommsen (Onomasticon,
Keil's second ed), apparently on the strength of this letter only, thinks that

= two marriages must have been ceutracted in the reign of Domitian, in which

case the ‘socrus‘ mentioned in Ep. ra.8 must be the mother of a wife ¹

married when Pliny was still ‘adulescentulus' who afterwards made way by
death for the daughter of Pompeia Celerina.

But the passage before us does not ¹clearly state that the two marriages
were contracted in Domitian's time, but only that the fact of his wishing to
have children even theu is proved by the fact of his not having waited till
now to be married, but having married once before, as well as once now,

twice in all. We may perhaps suppose thur Pliny, like an advocate, gave l

tlre sentence an equivocal turn to make his case look better than it was.
