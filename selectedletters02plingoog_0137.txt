120 Neres,

26. Non temetum eundem. There is always something fresh about
him. ,

28. An ..... conquireremus? ‘An’ cannot introduce (like ⁸ num’ or
‘nonne') a simple independent question. Here it introduces a question of a
‘supplementary kind, an inquiry what must be the case otherwise, in case
some objection is made to the foregoing,' i.e. in this instance to the
assumption that au author's being alive ought not to stand in the way of his
honour. See Madvig. 5 453. ‘An’ may therefore be rendered ‘or.’

30. Imagines. Not only were statues of public men frequent in cities and
private houses in Italy (cp. Bk. 1. 17), but the great men of literature were
honoured in a similar way. Caligula (Suet. Calig. 34) thought of banishing
the busts of Virgil and Livy from all libraries, which proves that they must
have been common.

Ep. 12. Tranquillus, to whom this letter is addressed, is the historian
Caius Suetonius Tranquillus, author of the lives of the Caesare. He was
younger than Pliny, perhaps by ten years or more; his father fought at the
battle of Bedriacum, at which Otho was defeated, sn. 69. The son was a
literary man, and shunned public offices; at least we hear of his declining a
military tribuneship which Pliny could have procured him (Bk. 3'. 8). The
latter speaks of him, in a letter to Trajan, as a man ot' the highest integrity
and of leamiug. Trai. 95. He was the author ofa number of works on
antiquities, biography, and criticism, and as ‘Magister Epistolarum' under
Hadrian, had· necess, no doubt, to important documents for his biographical
work. Smith's Dict. Biog.

3. καὶ γάρ. Hom. ll. 1. 63.

4. Refert temen . . . . somniare, ‘but it is a material point whether it
is your habit to dream things that will turn out true or exactly the reverse'
The ancients had a superstition that some dreams were to be interpreted by
contraries: to be beaten or killed portended sometimes a piece of good
fortune. Apul. Met. 4. p. 155, quoted by Corte.

7. Iuni Pastoris, perhaps that Pastor, to whom Mart. Ep. 9. 23
is addressed.

8. socrus, Pompeia Celerina (Ep. t. 4), mother ofPliny’s first (or second)
wife, not of Calpurnia. See on Ep. 41.

9. Eram aeturus adulescentulus. He began to plead inhis uineteenth
year; and from what he says below, this dream must have related to one of
his early causes.

Quadrupltot iudicio, ‘the four courts.' These formed the tribunal
mentioued a few lines below as the iudicium centumvirale, the court in
which Pliny usually practised‚ and which he calls his ‘arena’ It was under
the presidency of the praetor, and was divided into four sets of ‘iudices'

· t‘concilia' or ‘iudicia'), who however sometimes sat together in one J
building and heard the same causes. From other letters of Pliny we learn .

that these causes were often on tritling or uuinteresting matters of business;
frequently concerniug wills. Cicero (de Or. 1. 38) mentions a number of the
