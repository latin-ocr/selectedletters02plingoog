a high place among Roman orators (‘ Insigne moestis praesidinm reis’ Hor.
Od. a. 1, 13). Quintilian praises him for imagination‚ diligence. vigour and

None of his works remain.

Caelium. M. Caelius Rufus was a younger contemporary of Cicero,
having been born nc. 82, the same year and day as Licinius Calvus. He
was a man of taient and eloqueuce, but extravagant and unprincipled. He
was defended by Cicero (pro Caelio) when accused of attempting murder,
and was afterwards one of Cicero's correspondents (Fam. 8). Seneca calls
him ‘orator iracundissimus' (de Ira 3. 8); and the author of the Dial. de
Orat. (21) ranks him with Caesar, Calvus, and ethereas an orator, although
considering him wanting in grace. liis speeches hare not come down to us.

inargrrment.'

27. In quibus . . . . indicetur, ‘in which a short, bare notification
of certain charges is expressed under mere heads.' He refers to Cicero's
answer to Postumius. After saying ‘Respondebo igitur Postumio primum,¹

speech for Varenus ia lost.

sumebat, et numerus neque dierum neque patronorum finiebatur' Dial. de
Orat. 38. Pliny complains (Ep. 52) that speeches had become too short, in
his time. Cicero’s speech for Cornelius is lost, except fragments.

60. Iugulum statim video, &c. This is mentioned by Qintilian ss a
