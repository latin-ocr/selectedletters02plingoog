LETTERS OF C. PLINIUS 0. SEpUNDUS. 149

passage be thus filled up, ‘ hoc, utcumque id fiat. tolerabile est.’ lle admits
that it is endurable, though he.does not clearly see lrow it can be so. For
the use cp. ‘Excepto quod adhuc utcumque valemus' Ov. Ep. ex Pont. 4. 14. 3.

14. Acerba, ‘untimely’ The sentence is an apology for applying this
epithet to the death. not of a child but of a grown man.

21. Iaeotulo. See note oo Ep. ²4· 11.

aa. Habitum, ‘attitude.'

F* scrinium not a desk to write upon, but a box to hold what was
written.

30. Frustre3 in prcparing materials for another volume, which he was
presented from writing.

up. 47. ln a bantering humour he personifies the epigrams in which he
had promised the appearance of Suetonius’ book, and speaks of his verses as
having given bail for its appearance, and being called upon in legal form to
answer their obligation. For Suetonius see on Ep. 12.

a. Appellantur. ‘Hendecasyllabi' is the nominative to this verb, and
also to ‘cogantur,' since ‘scripta' must evidently be supplied as an accus.
after ad exhibendum.

3. Ad exhibendum formulam recipere, to undergo legal proceed-
iugs, such as to make them bring the ‘scripta' into court. These ‘formulae'
were drawn to suit every variety of case, and frorn thern the plaintiff chose
that which suited him, and inserted his own particulars. ‘ formulam intendere*
was said of the plaintiff‚ ‘formulam accipere' of the defendant. ‘Exhibere’
is a technical term, meaning ‘to bring into court? ' The use of the gerund
in this passage is remarkable; and, as it stands after ‘ formulam recipere,' it
must be translated ‘with regard to bringing thern forward.' ‘Ad' with the
gerund is not employed in finrl clauses for ‘ut' with subj.

6. vicisti. ‘you have surpassed.’

8. Sooaontes, or ‘choliambi’ ‘limping iambres: were so called from
σκάζω, ‘to limp,' andare iambic trimeters with a spondee or trochee in the
place of the final iambus. They were invented by Hipponax of Elis, who
recorded in this metre his experience of the married state:

A'v' ἡμέραι γυναικόε εἰσιν ἥδισται.

Ὀταν γαμῇ rrs κάκφέρῃ τεθνηκυῖαν.
Scazons were not exclusively employed for satire, witness Catullus’ beautiful
poem on Sirmio. Cat. 29.

ro. ‘titulum tuum. See note on ⁴ indicis' Ep. ²5· 3.

Ep. 48. 1. Munioipium, sc. Comum. “

a. heminae viae orarum. ‘Qratuorviri viis curandis' had existed
under the republie; but Augustus increased their number, separated the care
of the roads within the city frorn that of the roads without ir, and finally
gave a lasting dignity to the office by himself undertaking the care of the
‘via flaminia: and allotting the other ‘viae’ to men of note.

Under the ‘Curatores' were ‘mancipes' who contracted to perform the
repairs which the former thought necessary.
