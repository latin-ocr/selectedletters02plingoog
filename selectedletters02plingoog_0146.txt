Suspensus et tubulatus: see on Ep. 30. 8. The ‘tubi' were
earthenware pipes for conveying hot air.

41. Plerisque tam mund1s3 supply ‘cellis’ or ‘cubiculis‘ The sub-
stantive is omitted, as the context leaves no doubt of the sense. There may
be truth in Buchner's explanation that these rooms, although not large
enough for ‘cubicula' were yet too good to be called ‘cellae 3' hence the
omission. Here again is a descriptive abl. connected with the words ‘reliqua
pars!

49. Baptisteria, baths large enough sor immersion. but not lor swimming.

such as an ‘unctorium’ and a ‘propnigeon' lt is not clear whether the
‘tepidarium' contained a tepid bath, or whether it was merelya warm room
to sit in.

play immediately preceded the bath, this was the natural place sor the
‘ sphaeristerium!

59. apothecam here was kept the wine in ‘amphorae' (in bottle).
The ‘apotheca ' was generally, as here. on the first-door, and near the bathe,
that the wine might henefit hythe smoke oi the furnace. ‘Delia' (wine in ·
cask) were kept in the ‘cella vinaria' on the ground-floor. See Becker's
Gallus, Sc. 9. Eae. 4.

62. Gestatio, an avenne or drive running round the garden.

66. Vinee ς the vine was sometimes allowed to run wild on the ground
without supports, ‘vignes contantes' This was one of the five recognised
methods eteultivation. See Pliny N. H. 17. 6.

69. Heo . . . faeie, ‘this view,' i. e. oi the garden.

71. Vestibulum in town houses this was merely the vacant space
