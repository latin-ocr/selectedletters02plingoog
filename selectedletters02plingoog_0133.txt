NOTES.

‘Convictus thermae, stationes, omne theatrum
De Rutilo‘ Juv. 11. 4.

13. Nonianum. M. Servilius Nonianus was celebrated both as an historiari
andan orator. When relating his death (an. 60), Tacitus speaks of him
as ‘ diu soro, mox tradendis rebus Romanis celebris et elegantia vitae' Anu.
1419. Quintilian, who had heard him, considered him a man os marked
genius; but his style, though rich, was somewhat too diffirse for history: ‘Clari
vir ingenii, et sententiis creber, sed minus pressus quarn historiae auctoritas
postulat’ 10. 1. He was consul an. 35, under Tiberius.

16. Quia non perdiderit. The subj. does not necessarily follow
‘ quia.¹ It expresses not the actual or objective cause of the complaint, but
the idea which was the ground of it, and is used here with a delicate irony:
‘they complain that they have lost a day on the ground that—they have
not lost it!

ao. Ut non simut at nos amet. ‘Ut nou'isused thus aster negative, .

propositions to denote an ineritable consequence. ‘There is no one who
loves literature, but he must also love me.' ‘Ruere illa non possunt, ut
haec non eodem labefacta motu concidant' cic. pro L. Man. 7. Madvig,
§440- a·

24· Non auditor . . . . creditor, ‘to haye been there not to listen but
to put them under an obligation.' Pliny shows more delicacy than Juvenal,
who wants an equivaleut for his attendauce : ‘Nunquamne reponam' Juv. 1. 1.

up. 9. Junius Mauricus, to whom this letter is addressed, was (like his
brother Arulenus Rusticus)a man ot' courage and iudependence ot' character.
lle was one of the set of good men banished by Domitian at the close of his
reign, when his brother Rusticus was put to death. Even towards Vespasian
he had shown his boldness, in requesting that the emperor's j0umals might
be inspectcd iu order to bring the informers to justice. lle returned from
banishment in the reign of Nerva, and used similar frecdom towards him.
‘Quo viro nihil firmius, nihil verius’ is Pliny‘s description of him (Ep. 42. 9).
This letter and another (Ep. aa), answering an enquiry made by Mauricus
ior a tutor for his brother's orphan children, show the care with which
he attended to their interests.

8. Aruleno Rustico. Rusticus is mentioned by Tacitus in his account
oi the murder of Thrasea by Nero, as then an ardent young man who would
have interposed his veto, as tribune, on the decree ot' the senate condemning
Thrasea, unless the latter had forbidden him, as it would only have led to
his own destruction. ln the civil wars that followed Nero's death, Rusticus
was praetor when Vespasian’s forces advanced on Rome, and being sent by
Vitellius to offer them conditione oi peace, was wouuded and nearly killed.
With others ol the best men in Rome he was put to death by Domitian, ior
writing in praise of Thrasea. For a general view of the sufferings oi Pliny's
friends see on Ep. 28.

12. A vobis, the brothers above mentioned, Junius Mauricus and Arulenus
Rusticus.
