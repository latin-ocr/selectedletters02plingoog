lile, and, though much older thau himself, had shewn the warmest interest
in his success. On two occasions he relates that he had recourse to him ior
advice in important professional matters, esteerning him oue oi the most
experienced and wisest lawyers of his time. From this letter we leam that
Corellius survived Domitian (who was murdered Sept. 17, am. 96), and he
afterwards spoke highly oi Pliny to the emperor Nerva. On his deathbed
he mentions Pliny to his daughter as one of the friends she could most rely
on, and both she and her aunt Corellia found him ready to do them kind·

1. Si notura dicende est. The word ‘ iactura' frona its application to
everyday losses of money, property, dcc„ had material associations, which to
Pliny's refinement made it unsuitable to use oi the death ni such a friend as
Corellius.

ra. 'rot pignora, sc. dham. uxorem, dcc. In post-Augustan Latin
‘pignora’ was applied to all near relations, not merely to children, as the
English phrase ‘pledges.' Cp. Paneg. 37.

ar. Isti latroni. Domitian, whose cruelty became more atrocious in the
lew last years of his reign. See Merivale, c. 62.

‘st’ as here, is osten omitted before a supposition. 'l'he subjunctive is used
here because the supposition is false or imaginary. See the distinction
between the sense of the indic, and subj. (when ‘si' is omitted), as explained
by Madvig, 5 44² a, Obs. a.

39. Hispulla. possibly Calpurnia Hispulla, aunt oi Pliny's wile Calpurnia
(Ep. 41), in which case there would have been a connection as well aa a
close friendship between Pliny and the house oi Corellius.

⁵ ll't may remark that Pliny seems to have considered it praiseworthy iu

Corellius to escape continued suffering by suicide. The practice had become r

quite common at this time; but it would bea mistalre to think that it was
couutenanced by the Stoica. Mr. Merivale remarks that ‘we need not pass
too austere a Judgment on the sick and aged who thus courted present reliet'
