- (Onomast. Kell’s second ed.) that Pompeia Celerina, whom Pliny speaks ol

as his ‘socrus’ (Bk. 1. 4.), was not the mother of Calpurnia, but ol a former
wile of Pliny.

We find Calpurnia hastening to comfort her aunt Hispulla at the death os
Fabatus, Hispulla's father, Trai. 120. There is a letter addressed to Fabatus,
Bk.4. 1. ·

12. In proximo. See on Ep. 4. 4. For further proofsoi Pliny’s con-
jugal affection see Epp. 54 and 56.

14. Formas ‘sets them to music)

26. Invicem, ‘in turn,' i.e. first a wife for Pliny, then a husband lor
Calpurnia.

Ep. 42. 1. In eonsilium adsumptus. The emperors had a limited
number of advisers whom they summoned ior consultatiom just as inferior
officere, eg. praetors and proconsule summoned their ‘consiliarii’ The
famous ‘Conncil of the Turbot' (Juv. 4. 73 sqq.), whether real or fictitious,
testifies to the existence of this custom, which is said to have been instituted
by Augustus. Pliny was often summoned (‘ frequenter in consilio fui· Ep. 13.
51), as for instance in the trial of Atticinus, Bk. 6. aa, and that of Ariston,
with others, Bk. 6. 31. See Menon, Hist. Emp. c. 67.

2. Viennenses, ‘the people of vienne) Vienna, now Vienne, is
situated on the Rhone‚ not far below Lyons. It was a city oi great

importance under the Empire, and the site oia llourishing Christian church. i

The remains of a large amphitheatro still confirm what is here said of the
taste of the inhabitants ior spectacles. This amphitheatro was probably
the scene of many martyrdoms during the great persecution by Aurelius,
A.1>.177.

4. In duumviratu. The provincial towns were governed by senators
(⁴ decuriones')‚ who elected duumvirs from their own body. The duumvirs
united in their persons the fonctions separately exercised at Rome by the
consuls and praetors. The duumvirs were originally elected hy the people
in each place; but the transference of the Roman comitia to the senate was
followed hya similar change in the provinces. Smith's Dict. Ant. art. ²
'Colonia'

8. cum sententiae perrogarentur. Cp. ‘Parum est ut censentes
audias, nisi et perroges’ Pan. 60. ‘Perrogo'=‘deinceps rogo,’ to ask iu ³

. order. Here the opinions ol the ‘consiliarii' were asked all the way down

iu order as they sat.
9. Iunius Mauricus. See note on Ep. 28. 10 sub fin.

11. Etiam Romae. These performances had been iostered to excess by
'omitian See Merivale‚ Hist. Emp. c. 62.

Pliny's assent to the stemness of Mauricus is somewhat inconsistent with
what he says to Maximus, Ep. 63, although it be in accordauce with his ³
J'udgment on the Circenses. Ep. 75. See also note ou Ep. 64. 13.

14. Veiento ς his power as a creature of Domitian was so great, that a
mem look irom him was a boon; luv.3. 185. He is recorded as present
