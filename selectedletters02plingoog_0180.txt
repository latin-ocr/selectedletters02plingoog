campaign was undertaken to avenge the defeat of Fuscus (Juv. 4. 111),
and the humiliation os Domitian, who is said to have consented to the
payment osa tribute to Decibalus the Dacian king. In the first campaign
Trajan penetrated to the beart of Dacia, established a garrison there, and

obtained the complete submission of Decibalus. On his return he celebrated ·

a triumph, and received the name of Dacicus.

It was not long before the Dacians, by violating the treaty, provokeda
second invasion, which ended in the defeat and death of Decibalns, and
the settlement of Dacia as a Roman province. For a full account of the
Dacian war, see Merivale, Hist. Emp. c. 63.

4. Inmiess terris nove flumine. Decibalus temporarily diverted a
river from its course, that he might conceal his treasure in its bed. Traian
repeated the operation to recover the treasnre, and this may possibly be the
exploit to which Pliny alludes.

Itonos pontem the bridges ol boats thrown over the Danube in
the first campaign, and the massive permanent bridge constructed in pre-
paration for the second campaign.

5. Montium sumpts. These were the great difficulties of a campaign
in that region.

Pulsum regia, namely from Zermizegethusa, captured in the first
campaign.

6. Pulsum etlam viba. Decibalus fell by his own hand at the cap·
ture of his hill sort. This completes a noticeable parallel between the
Dacian campaign and the late Abyssinian expedition, both being triumphs
oi engineering skill and os discipline rather than of valour, though
the resistance of the Dacian was os course more formidable than that of
Theodore. The story os the captive Longinus affords another point of
similarity.

means ‘they rebound from the helmet.' Here ‘resultare Graecis versibus’
expresses the stubbom unfitness of Dacian names for Greek memes, with
which, as it were, they rebound from them. The labor lies in obviating
this difficulty, ‘utnon resultent! ’

17. Non delicate sed necessarie, ‘demanded not by caprice but by
necessity!

Ep. 72. 1. cucumam the Clitumnus falls into theTinia, a tributary
of the Tiber. The excellence of the cattle fed on its banks made them
in request at great festivals. Virgil mentions them among the glories
of Italy: ‘ilinc albi Clitumne greges' Georg. a. 146. The beauty and ce-
lebrity of the spot attracted Caligula (Suet. Cal. 43) and Honorius (Claud.
Cous. lion. Sext. 506) to visit it.
