156 NOTES.

formula of appeal to the citizens, ‘Porro Qrirites,' used by those in danger

of injustice or illtreatment. Varr. de Ling. Lat. 5. 7. So in a fragment of

Laberius, preserved in Macrob. Sat. a. 7, we find the words ‘Porro Qirites,

libertatem perdimus‚' put into the mouth of a man who is being scourged.
63. Illud . . . illud, this part and that part of the town.

71. Misero, to be construed with solacio.
74. Deficit, the proper word for eclipse. Cp. ‘Solis defectiones itemque

lunae praedicuntur in multos annos' Cic. de Div. a. 6.

77. Utcumque: see note on Ep. 46. 7.

up. 62. 1. Tollite cuneta, the address of Vulcan to his Cyclopes, Virg.
Aen. 8. 439.

3. Illa. arma, the arms to be made for Aeneas. The comparison is not
exact, as Vulcan did not bring the arms, but the order for them. ,

8. Intra undecim diee, quam· This involved idiom requires to be
traced carefully. The simplest construction would have been ‘undecim
diebus postquam? But sometimes ‘post' is transferred to the beginning of ,
the sentence, and the phrase left to stand thus, ‘post undecim dies quam’
Madvig, ς 270, Obs. 4, note; cp. ξ 276, Obs. 6. But in the present instance
‘post’ would not exactly express the meaning of the writer, and ‘iutra' is
substituted for it. Thus ‘post’ disappears from the sentence, but ‘quam’
which belonged to it syntactically, is nevertheless retained, and forced into
conjunctiora with ‘intra' Cp. ‘intra quintum quam affuerat diem’ Suet. Jul.

35. Such instances of the construction proper to one particle being applied
to another, are characteristic of a decaying language. Ι

9. Quadruplioi iudicio: see note on Ep. ra. 9. ⁸

subsellia, occupied by the audience. The same terms are employed
in the description of the court, Ep. 20. a 5.

14. Tribunel, the raised dais at the further end of the basilica, on which
the judges sat. It was sometimes thrown back in the forrn of an apse, and
on the conversion of basilicas into churches became the sanctuary where the
altar was placed.

Elx superiore basilicae parte, the galleries, which are somewhat nb-
scurely described by Vitruvius 5. 1. lt was difficult for persons in them to hear
the proceedings‚ but easy to look down and see them. They were reached
by a staircase from the outside of the building. They were defended bya
low balustrade from the hall within, and were probably open to the air, being Ἰ
little more than the roofs of the side aisles.

18. Duobus consiliis, by the verdict of two out of the four ‘consilia' ξ
into which the 180 judges were divided. lt appears at first sight that the l
verdict of two out of the four carried the day in Pliny's favour. But as two l
points on which he was successful are mentioned below, vieta noverea . . . Ῐ
vietus suberinus, it may be that each of the four ‘consilia' though
sitting together, gave its verdict on a different issue in the case, and that
