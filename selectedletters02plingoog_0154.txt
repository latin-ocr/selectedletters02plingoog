LETTERS OE 0. PLINIUS 0. SECUNDUS. 137

49. currentem quoqu03 this frequent proverbial expression continues
the metaphor introduced by stimulis, lit. goads.

50. Ἀγαθή δ’ ἔρις, in allusion to llesiod's distinction between good 3ηά
bad strife, competition and contention. Hesiod describes the former thus,

ἤτε aul ἀπαλαμόν asportassent ἔργον ἐγείρει.
Hes. Op. et Di. ao.

mp. 28. a. In maius. This phrase (with ‘iu melius‚’ ‘in peius,¹ arc.) is ,
frequent in Pliny and writers of his age. Cp. also Sall. Jug. 73, and hrt τὸ
μεῖζον κοσμεῖν, Thuc. 1. 21. ’

4. Quum essent philosophi ab urbe summoti. In nn. 86 Do·
mitian revived the decrees of Vespasian against the philosophers.

6. nui praetor. lle allowed himself to be promoted by Domitian until
that emperor's final outbrealr of cruelty in the slaughter of Senecio, Rusticus,
3ηά the rest. After this he determined to retire into privacy. yet he was
obliged to fuliil the remaining term of his office as praetor. ‘Provectus ab
illo insidiosissime principe antequam profiteretur odium bonorum, postquam
professus est substiti' Plin. Pan. 95.

8. Mussentibus. By the whispering murmure of persons in doubt,
‘musso’ passes from the sense of murmuring to that of hesitation, which
latter is frequent enough; cp. ¹ Mussat rex ipse Latinus Quos generos vocet'
Virg. ileu. 12. 657.

10. septem amicis mels. This seems a convenient opportunity for
some account of that great and ill-fated family, of whose virtues and sorrows
these letters so often speak. Ep. 31 contains nearly aa much as is known
of Caecina Paetus 3ηά Arria his wife, who perished for his share in the
conspiracy of Scribonianus against the Emperor Claudius aas. 42. They
left a daughter, Arria the younger, already married to Paetus Thrasea,
afterwards the noblest of Nero's¹ victims, in the narrative of whose death
tlre last extant book of the Annals of Tacitus comes abruptly to a close.
Thrasea’s widow, Arria the younger, survived to see the disasters of her
family, and the final return of happier days under Nersa. The next
me'mber of the family is one ol whom Pliny writes with more than usual
affection, Ep. 67. Thrasea Paetus left one daughter, Fannia, married
before his death to Helvidius Priscus, who escaped his father-in-law's
fate only by the'alternative of banishment, from which he returned with
his wife after the accession of Vespasian. Again the same sentence was
pronounced, 3ηά 3 second time Fannia followed her husband into exile. ‘bis
maritum secuta in exsilium est’ Ep. 67. ra. The enemies of Helvidius, aud
his own indiscretion, changed tlte sentence to that ol death; and Helvidius,
under Vespasian‚ met the fate of his father-inlaw Thrasea under Nero·
Fannia returned to Rome with Helvidius the younger, her husband’s sort
by a previous marriage. This HelvidIus was subsequently married to Anteia,
who, like her husband, had to deplore 3 murdered father, Anteius, Tac. hun. 16.
14. Fannia's troubles were not ended, for Domitian had yet to reign. stre
furuished Senecio with materiale for a life of her husband, 3ηά with her
