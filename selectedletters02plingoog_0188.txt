LETTERS OF U. PLINIUS C. SECUNDUS. 171

Pliny could find no special enactmeut for Bithynia (proprium) nor any

universal enactment for the empire which might be applied to the case of
the Bithyniam.

7. Exemplo, ‘a precedent.

10. Achaeos. Unless we omit ‘Achaeos’ ‘dein ad’ must be inserted
before the word, as in the Aldine edition.

Ep. 88. a. Sublati. ‘Tollo’ has the special sense of taking up new-born

children from the ground as a sign that they were to be reared. ι

7. Intermissa, Orelli's¹ emendation for ‘inter quas? Keil’s own is more
ingenious, ‘iutra eas provincias de quibus rescripsit inter quas non est

Bithynia-¹ ,

8. Adsentionem. ‘Adsero' may be used indiffereutly with ‘in liber-

tatem’ or ‘iu servitutem! Suet. Vitell. 10; Tib. a.

10. Ipsam libertatem. ‘Ipsam' throws au emphasis on ‘libertatem'
¹ which may perhaps be rendered by translating the words ‘natural liberty)
Their status was already that of freedom itself, and did not, in Trajan's
opinion, require to be made so by any payment to their foster parents for
the expensas of nurture.
Redimendnm, ‘requiring redemptos! '

- np. 89. 1. Nicomedensi Nicomedia was the ancient capital of the
kings of Bithynia. Two hundred years after Pliny's time it was chosen by
Diocletian as the capital of his eastern share of the empire, and was then,
according to Gibbon, inferior only to Rome, Antioch, and Alexandria in its
extent and populousness.

a. Cum detineretur. The bakers to whom he-had engaged himself as
ajoumeymau having discovered that he was a runaway slave endeavoured to
make him their own slave.

4 confregisse ed tuem statuam. Statuesof the emperors shared the
right of asylum possessed by temples of the gods. This privilege of
sanctuary was much abused, Tac. Ann. 3. 36. lt seems to have been the
only merhod of appeal which slaves had in case of ill usage; hence we find a
‘constitutio' of Antoninus Pius to the effect that if a slave in a province
fled to a temple or a statue to avoid ill treatment, the authorities could
compel his master to sell him, and the slave was not to be regarded asa
runaway.

6. Susago. Susagus was probablya Dacian general who took partin '

the invasion of Moesia by Decibalus in the first year of Domitian, nn. 81.
This was twenty-three years before the time of Pliny's writing this letter,
which would leave rcum for the many years (pluribus annis) mentioned
below.
Decibalo. Decibalus was probably not a persoual name, buta title,

lilre that of Pharaoh. See Merivale's Hist. Emp. c. 61.

10. Mittendum od te putavi. He thought Trajan would bc glad to
gather frorn him information about the state of Dacia aud Parthia, both of
which he afterwards invaded and conquered.
