LETTERS OF G. PLINIUS Ο. SECUNDUS. 117

13. Brixis, Brescia, eighteen miles west of the Lago di Garda (Benacus).
Nostra Italia, sc. ‘ltalia transpadana,’ Pliny's native country. Cp.
‘Veronensibus nostris’ 6. 34.

16. Equestris ordinis princeps, ‘a chief man of the equestrian order.’
lt does not appear to denote an office. The term ‘princeps iuventutis’ was
different, and was given at this time to princes oi the emperor's family
Tac. Ann. 1. 3.

Adiectus. The word was used technically of persons chosen to till up
vacant places in the senate or other orders.

17. Praetorem, ‘men of the rank of praetor ;' not necessarily who had
held the office of praetor. The ornaments and rank of praetor, sometimes
of consulor of quaestor, were granted occasionally as honorary distinctions.
Such distinctions gave the right of a seat iu the senate. Cp. ‘ornamenta
praetoria· Bk. 7. ²9· Tac. Anu. 1a· 21.

18. Huio nostrae . . dignitati, ⁴ this (shall 1 call it parade or) dignity of
mine:’ namely, that of senator. Pliny was unwilling to own to himself
how little of its ancient power the senate now retained, and threw himself
into his duties as heartily as if tlte republic still existed. The senate had
been thinned by the cruelties of Nero, and by the civil wars that followed.
Vespasian, after the example of Augustus and Claudius, caused an enquiry to
be made into the fortunes and characters of the senators, degrading some
and appointing others, and he extended this measure also to the knights.
Many of his new senators were provinciales class of men who had been
lirst admitted by Julius Caesar. Such persons resided at Rome, and were
not usually allowed to return horne without express leave. Such measures
were exceedingly useful‚ both in interesting the provinces in the affairs of
government, and in infusing new blood into the senate, since the provincial
senators were men oi simplet habits than the Roman nobles. Tac. Ann.
3. 55; 11. 25. Suet. Vesp. 11.

ao. Municipio Patavino, ‘the free town of Padua‚' best known as
Livy's birthplace. Pliny's remarks on the character of the inhabitants of
North ltaly is¹ interesting, as from his writings he appears himself to have
retained many of the pure and simple tastes which marked his countrymen.

Looi mores, exemplified hythe noble Thrasea Paetus, also a native of
Padna. Tacitus calls him ‘virtus ipsa' Ann. 16. 21.

17.1nmprose,&c. ‘lam’is the emphatic word. He already holdsa
distinguished position, and will give you no trouble in assisting him to
obtain office.

31. Nescio an adiiciam, ‘l think 1 moy add! See Madvig, ξ 453.

32· Oum imaginor, ‘when l picture to myself.' The word is used
several times by Pliny, but is not comrnon in earlier writers. Epp.18. 19
and 54. 11.

35. Census. For admission both to the equestrian and senatorian rank
a certain fortune was necessary. For the knights it was 400 sestertia, for the
senators it was fixed by Augustus at 1200 sestertia, i. e. 1200,0oo sestertii.
