He says further in support of this interpretation 01 · sacramentum ' in this
place, ‘The account given in this passage refers to what the whole assembly
were wont to do at the same3 they could not all come to receive Baptism,
though they might corne to receive the Eucharist' lb. Tertullian, oon-
trasting the commanda oi the Lord with superadded tradition, employs the
word ‘sacrament' to denote the Lord's Suppes, and also confirms Pliny's
account oi its being received before daybrealr. ‘Eucharistiae sacramentum, et

iu ternpore rictus, et onrnibus mandatnm a Domino; etiam 0010111001ιί0 ’

coetibus nec de aliomm manu quam praesidentium sumimus’ Tert. de Cor.
c. 5, p. roa, ed. Rig.

35. Rursusque coeundi3 i. e. ior the love feast in the weng, now
distinct from the Eucharist, which latter was no longer taken ⁸ in tempore
victus' at meai-time, Tert. l. c. ‘Coeundi' is inserted from the Aldine
edition.

36. Promiscuum, ‘ordinary’ cp. ‘promiscua et vilia‚' common and
cheap articles‚' Tac. Germ. 5 This account 01 the iood at the Agapae was
given by the Christians' rn refutation 01 the common charge that they ate
human ilesh; a charge which arose from the language which they employed
respecting the Body and Blood 01 Christ

58. Hetaerice. Clubs or gussds, lor whatever purpose were loolred ou as
dangerous; cp. Trai. 54 and 93. This being so. the doctrine 01 the unity 01
the Church 01 Christ, and the practice of ¹ love 01 the brethren' would, so
iar aa they were understood, appear to the gorernment ruore formidable
than the other features 01 Christianity.

39. Ministrne, apparently a translation of διάκονοι, deaoonesses, a
recognised order iu the early Church, Rom. 16.1. .

46. Civitates. Here we see ‘ civitas ’ on its way to the exclusive sense
01 · clty‚' which it has reached in modern languages. But in Cioero we lind
a distinction clearly laid down between ⁸ civitates‚' commonwealths 01 ‘ 01101,ν
and ‘urbes’ the places 01 their hahitation. Pro Sest. 42. Iu Gellius we find
note taken 01 the confusion 01 the two words, aud the use 01 ‘civitas ' ‘pro
oppido et pro hominum multitudine' Geli. 18. 7.

50. Pastum. It does not appear how the food 01 victims differed from
that 01 other cattle. They may perhaps have been graaed in the precincts
01 the temple at the expense nithe intending sacrificet.

up. 91. a. nequeenim in universum. Trajan refuses to write
such a ‘rescript' as might be taken lora law 01 the empire (see on Ep. 86. 4),
aud confines himself to an approval 01 Pliny's conduct. Trajan seems to
have thought that the new sect would require different treatment according
to the political condition 01 the places in which it appeared; ior his point 01
view was political‚ and his obiect rather the peace thau the orthodoxy 01 the
empne.

4. conquirendi non sunt. ‘0 sententiam necessitate confusam!
Negat inquirendos, ut iunocentesa et mandat puniendos ut nocentes' Terent
Apa.
