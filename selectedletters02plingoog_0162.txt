LETTERS OE 0. PLINIUS Ο. SECUNDUS. 145

50. Quam fiduciam. This, like the close of Ep. 37, is one of those
- epigrammatic surprises which stamp Pliny's prose as well as Martial’s verse
with the character of ‘Flavian polish and refiuement.’

In conclusion it will be worth while to put together what can be gathered
frorn this letter respecting education in tlte provinces.

Schools oi two separate kinds were in existence, firsssy, government
schools, not uncommon (⁴ multis in locis’); and secondly, schools established
by public subscription where sufficient money could be raised to engage a
teacher. We do not hear of teachers starting schools on a private venture.
They expected to be engaged (⁸ conduci') with acertaiupayment guaranteed.
lf there was a good school in any place, boys came from a distance and
took lodgings in the place to attend it.

Pliny's views set forth in this letter attest not only his generosity and
interest in education, but a shrewd judgment in the matter quite on a level
with modern opinion. He sees the danger of bad appointments likely to
ariae from lixed payments and centralization, and he also sees the necessity
oi some subsidy to encourage local effort. ’

We must add to the list os his benefits to Comum the establishment ola
public 'library, and an endowment for the support of a certain number ol
free-bom children. Bk. 1. 8.

np. 40. 5. corelli filiam3 perhaps the first cousin of Pliny’s second
wile Calpurnia. See note on the following letter. For Corellius see note on

15. Contra, ⁴ just the other way!

16. Ponitus inspexi. Pliny uses the same phrase with reference to
Euphrates, Ep. 6. 4: and of TraJan, Pan. 83.

17. Nihil a meg supply ‘habuit'

21. numerator et testis. Cp. ‘Testes et laudatores dabat, vel eum
sub quo militaverat, vel eum cui quaestor luerat, vel utrumque si poterat.
Addebat quosdam e suffragatoribus: illi graviter et paucis loquebantur' Ep.
34'. 15. Though this description refers toan earlier state of things, yet no
doubt something of the same order was observed in the time ol Pliny.

In inchoandis deductor. See note on Ep. 16. 3²·

26. Do bonis iuvenibus. Pliny was, at the time mentioned, thirty-live
years of age, and therefore in the period of ‘iuventus' which succeeded
‘adolescentia' and was reckoned to begin at about the age ol thirty.

36. Cornutum. Ep. 48 tells us all we know of Cornutus.

41. Nova lis. ‘Nova’ is limited by ut.

Eoeminee. The action, whatever it was, was ol a kind not usually
brought against a woman.

Ep. 41. This letter is addressed to Calpurnia Hispulla, daughter oi
Calpurnius Fabatus, and aunt of Calpurnia, Pliny's second (or third) wife..
whom Hispulla had brought up. The fact oi her having been brought up by
her aunt makes it probable that her mother, as well as her father, must have
died when she was a child; and hence we may conclude with Mommsen
