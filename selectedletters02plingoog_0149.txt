Remrlus, M. Aquilius, the soremost oi that nond. of ‘delatores' ,

which gathered round the bad emperors. He was a creature oi Domitian,
and is accordingly ilattered by Martial in four epigrams, which chiefly relate

ιο his escape from the fall oi a portico. Pliny in sketching this man's char· .
aeter unconsciously gives us a foll to his own. He was utterly wanting in ,
Pliny's high qualities oi honour, liberality, humanity, and truthfnlness. ’

Bk. 1. 5 gives an amu'sing account of his apprehension aiter the loss of his
patron Domitian. For the rise and influence of the delatores, see an admirable
sketch in Merivale, Hist. Emp. c. 44.

5. Impudentiam: cp. ‘hominem te patientem’ Ep. 18. 1.

10. cummterioum. All multiplea of 7 and 9 were called climacteric
years, and thought dangerous to lile. px 9=63 was therefore the grand
climacteric, cp. Gell. 3. 10. Regulus employed the term inuit jargon to
srighten Aurelia.

²9· scholasticelegs. Α common and erroneous interpretation is ‘like ’
an idle fellow,' which gives ‘tertiam’ no more sense than ¹ aliam! This is
much too pointless for our author’s style. There must be an allusion to some .
unknown precept of the schocls, perhaps one requiring that a thesis should ,

be illustrated by at least three instances; cp. Ep. 31, which is infacta theme
on the subject ‘ alia clariora, alia maiora,’ illustrated by three incidente from
the iiie oi Arria the elder.

5ο. Ornata, adjectival, not participial, in sense; ‘a lady oi rank!

Aurelia: we learn from another source also that she was an obieci
oi attention to ‘captatores' Juv. 5. 98. η

42. consuleret quamcito, ‘ was inquiring how soon?

45. Aliena tenimenta, ‘other people's vilis:

Inprobissimum genus falsi, ‘a most impudens kind of trickery.’
‘Falsum ' was a wider word than ‘forgery,' embracing also base coinage, and,
as we learn ironr this passage, undue influence.

46. Ipsis quorum euni ille. This is put thus emphatically to mark how
Regulus reversed the natural order of things. Usually the testator dictated
to sorne one else the ternas of his will; but here we find Regulus dictating
them to the testator. ‘Dicto’ is the te'chnical word, for such transactions.
Cp. ‘rivalis dictabitur heres* Juv. 6. 218.

Ep. 24. 8. Sera, ‘too iate’

11. Lectulos not in bed, but ou his writing conch. They used ior the
purposes oi study, not chaire and desks, but a conch, ‘lectus,’ ‘lectulus’
‘lecticula’ Cp. ‘lacere in lectulo suo compositus in habiturn studentis'

ra. coleson always worn in public with the toga. They covered the
whole sont, while the ‘soleae' worn at other times, were merely sandals.

21. Hoc is explained by ne praecipere videntur.

25. Lycios. Fonr mutilated lyrical fragments bearing the title ‘Ves-
tricius Spurinna De contemptu Saeculi ' were discovered and edited by Barthius
