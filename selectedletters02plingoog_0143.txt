‘anticipatiou,’ do not belong to classical usage, which preferred ‘prae-
cipro!

Ep. 19. a. lngo . . . debeo, ‘there is no one I had rather be in debt to! ¹

4. Beneficiorum lares materie. The commander of an army had in
his patronage the appointment of military tribunes, six tc each legion. That
these appointments were canvassed for appears from a similar request in
favour of Calvisius, Blr. 4. 4.

5. Longum praeterea tempus, during which many tribuneships would
fall vacant, as they were only held ior six months; cp. ‘semestri tribunatu)

Muses ipsas Latine loqui3 an adaptation of the eulogy of Plautus

ar. 'I'rium liberorum ius. The Leges Julia, a. c. 18, and Papia Pop-
paea, nn. 9, encouraged marriage and the nunure of children to supply the

Tac. Anu. 3. 25, divides the ‘praemla rohvrcrblns' into several heads. ,

(1) ‘Ut in petitione candidati praeferentur, quibus liberi plures.‘ (a) ‘Ut

iidem praeferantur in sorte provinciarum? (3) ‘Ut praeeant in omni r
magistratu ;' i.e. seniority between magistrates of equal ranlr was determined ¹

by this test. (4) ‘Ut ln honoribus petendis gratia sit annorum iis qui

qui plures liberos habet a cura tutela ceterisque muneribus immunis sit'
All the above privileges and immunities were sumnred up in the expression
⁴ ins trium liberorum' The senate, and afterwards the emperors, granted this
right to distinguished persons. We find'that Pliny obtained it for himself

7. Express03 ‘expressus' and its adverb ‘expresse' are terms of art in

general, and as such are applied to very different branches of art, such as
sculpture, painting, rhetoric, and elocution. There seems to be no one English
