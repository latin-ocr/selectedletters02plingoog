the value of Pliny’s share of the land Hermes reckoned the whole estate at
two hundred thousand sesterces below its real value, so that Corellia got the
part which she bought from him very cheaply.

13. Ludis meis; the ‘ludi Circenses vel Apollinares' were given by the
praetor, in accordance with the ‘carmen’ which had ordered their institution
when the Carthaginians were in Italy, rac. 212. They were at first vowed

afresh every year; but in consequence of a pestilence, e. c. 208, a law was ,

The appointed day was July 5.
Praecederit. Pliny had probably absented himself to mark his

indifference to popular amusements. Cp. 'Circenses erant, quo genere ’

spectaculi ne levissime quidem teneor' Ep. 75. 3.
14. ciros Larium nostrum. For ‘nostrum’ cp. ‘huius (Latii lacus)
in litore plures villae meae' Ep. 76. 4.

usual dative (Corelliae). Cp. ‘nisi sibi possessione hortorum cessisset ' Cic.

4. Partem vicesimam. This succession duty ol five per cent. had been
imposed by Augustus, and was the only direct tax levied on Roman
citizens. lt was paid on all inheritances except those which came from a
man's nearest relatives, or did not excecd a certain sum. lt was collected
by ‘procuratores' who in turn famred it out to ‘publicani' From this

be arrived at. The ‘publicani’ appear to have laid hands ona twentieth
part of the estate. and in buying back from them Corellia had become aware
of the real value of the property.

Ep. 66. 1. municipibus nostrin the people of Comum. ln Ep. 3. 1

7. In elimenta ingenuorum. He speaks in Bk. 1. 8 of the oration
in which he promised this endowment to his countrymen at Comum, and
the inscription mentioned above records also his liberality to the free-born
youth of Milan. Pliny was in this matter following the example of his
master Trajan, who had provided maintenance at his own expense for five

alimentation was continued up to the eighteenth year for males¹ and the
fourteenth for females. The object seems to have been to recruit the free·
born population by inducing needy parents not to expose their children, but
